        <h1> All about me!!</h1>
        <h3>By Cassius Klier</h3>
        <p>I live in an obescure neighborhood in north Bronx, Woodlawn. I live with my Mom, Dad, Brother and dog, Rey. I take the 2 train 233rd street but I will start taking the Metro North once my school metro card is re-instated.</p>
        <p> I am a 17-year-old senior at LaGuardia High School. My major is technical theater and my favorite class was last year's AP psychology with Ms McGoey(I got a 99.5 in the class)</p>
        <p>There are many things I want to do when I grow up. Photography is one of my biggest passions as Ive been able to produce 3 picture books in the last 2 years. This year, I got accepted into the advanced placement photography scholarship program at NYC Salt. I also applied myself to the tech-photographer role at school and a job at the Bronx Art Mueseum.</p>
