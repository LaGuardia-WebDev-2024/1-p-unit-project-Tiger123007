        <h1> All about me!!</h1>
        <h3>By Maximilian Tiger Beni Heinsohn</h3>
        <p>I am German/Swiss/Swedish/Soviet/French/Italian. I play Football(soccer) everyweekend. I like to read and play video games. I recently just read Crime and Punishment and tommorow the new Fifa Game comes out!</p>
        <p>I live on the East Side in Manhattan. I live with my Mom, Dad, and Sister. I take the 6 train from 96th street but sometimes I bike across central park. I may move to water street so then I would take the 1</p>
        <p> I am a 16 year old Junior at LaGuardia High School. My major is technical theater and my favorite class this year is computer deveoptment or Tech. </p>
        <p>Some of the things I want to do when I grow up are a Football (soccer) player/manager, maybe a Formula one driver/crew member, maybe I can go into engineering. I plan on applying to TUM in Munchen, Politecnico di Milano, and Delft in the Netherlands. </p>
